# NFHS-4-5-Analysis

Abstract—This research primarily investigates the role of different menstrual products on pregnancy conditions, and any possible complications, by corroborating it with the IABR dataset in NFHS-4 and NFHS-5. The attributes that stood out surrounded the different components of menstruation, pregnancy complica- tions, birth issues, hemoglobin levels, mother’s age and delivery costs and circumstances are used to find associations between menstrual products (like cloth, sanitary napkins, tampons, men- strual cup, local prepping, none) and pregnancy complications (vaginal bleeding, convulsions, prolonged labour, severe abdom- inal pain, high blood pressure). In order to draw insightful conclusions from our datasets we performed clustering, to explain the distribution of period products over different chosen clusters and association rule mining, to establish association rules for the attributes of interest. Temporal analysis was also performed using regression to understand the behavior according to the variations in the attributes over time.
